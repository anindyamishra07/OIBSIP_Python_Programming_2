# 🧮 BMI Calculator (Tkinter)

## 📖 Description
This project is a basic **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** created using Python and Tkinter.  
The application takes a user’s **weight (kg)** and **height (cm)** as input and calculates their BMI.  
It then displays both the BMI value and the corresponding health category.

## ✨ Features
- Simple and clean graphical interface  
- Easy input for weight and height  
- Quick BMI calculation with a single click  
- Shows health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)  
- Handles invalid inputs with error messages  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Tkinter** (for GUI development)  

## ⚙️ How the System Works
1. The user enters weight in kilograms and height in centimeters.  
2. When the **"Calculate your BMI"** button is clicked, the program applies the formula:  
BMI = weight / (height in meters)^2
3. The result is displayed in a message box along with the correct category.  

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
- Gained hands-on experience with Tkinter for GUI applications  
- Learned how to take and process user inputs  
- Implemented simple calculations and conditional logic  
- Understood how to add basic error handling in Python
